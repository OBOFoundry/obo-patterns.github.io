# How to model with Characteristics

Characteristics and qualities are a topic of central importance across many OBO ontologies. Talking about the `size`, `colour` or `shape` of a physical object, or the `rate of occurrence` of a process is ubiquitous across many domains such as phenomics, ecology and agronomy. 

Examples include:
1. `morphology` of an `anatomical entity`, e.g. the `length` of the `tibia`
2. `temperature` of a `liquid`
3. `redness` of `skin`
