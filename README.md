# OBO Templates and Design Pattern Library

We attempt to collect and document some of the more frequently used patterns across the OBO sphere, for example:

- Taxon constraints
- Qualities/characteristics
- Basic mereology (anatomical vs otherwise)

We will also provide an entry-point to search all pattern / templates, including DOSDP and ROBOT.

## Developer documentation

To update the user facing documentation run:
